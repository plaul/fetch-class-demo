        <h3>fetch with local caching of data</h3>
        <p>This example uses (will eventually) the following strategy to interact with the backend</p>
        <p>It fetches data from the server. STORES the data locally for future use (filter, sort, etc.) and build the
            table-rows from these data.</p>
        <p>For ADD, PUT and DELETE operations it delegate these operations to the server, but, it also updates the local
            representation of data, and re-renders the page from this updated list as outlined below</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li><b>POST</b> → For a successful POST operation it adds the new user (now with ID) returned by the server
                to the local list, and re-renders the table using this list
            </li>
            <li><b>PUT</b> → For a successful PUT operation it adds the edited user returned by the server to the local
                list, and re-renders the table using this list
            </li>
            <li><b>DELETE</b> → For a successful DELETE operation it removes the deleted user from the local list AFTER
                the server has responded with OK, and re-renders the table using this list
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Eventually we will add functionality to automatically update the list with potential changes from the
            server</em></p>

        <h3>fetch with (almost) no caching of data</h3>
        <p>After each change on the server we reload all data into our local list,OK, and re-renders the table using this list</p>
